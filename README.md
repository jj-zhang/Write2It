Acquiring a new language can be a challenging endeavour that often leads to individuals quitting part-way through the process of learning one. To make language-learning less daunting, this work aims to develop a fun and engaging story-writing web-game, *WriteIt*, a web application powered by React and NodeJS, supports players in learning English.

In the game, users piece together stories both collectively and incrementally; that is, each user contributes one sentence at a time, building from where a story had been previously left off by other users. In addition, users are given a specific word that they must incorporate in each sentence that they contribute. In this way, as a by-product of playing the game, users are able to foster better writing skills, build their vocabulary, and ultimately hone their mastery of English.
